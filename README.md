# Churn Analysis & Prediction using Tableau & Machine Learning

## Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, and analyzing churn patterns helps in developing retention strategies. This project involves:
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Tableau to understand customer behavior.
   - Visualization of churn trends using dashboards.
   - Predictive modeling using LightGBM to classify customers as churned or non-churned.
   - Evaluation of the ML model with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Comparison of actual vs. predicted churn using Tableau dashboards.

## Objectives

  - Identify Key Drivers Behind Customer Churn: Analyze customer data to pinpoint the primary factors contributing to churn.
  - Segment Customer Profiles: Classify customers according to their churn risk to understand which segments are most likely to leave the service.
  - Provide Data-Driven Recommendations: Develop actionable insights and strategies to help Databel reduce customer churn and improve customer retention rates.

## Tools and Technologies Used

  - **Tableau**: Data visualization, dashboards, and churn analysis.
  - **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: Data preprocessing and modeling.
  - **LightGBM**: Machine learning model for churn prediction.
  - **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and processing.
  - **Git and GitHub**: For Version Control.
